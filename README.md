# Cypress-template

With this template you can download the project and start working with Cypress E2E.

To run the tests in debug mode file by file with user interface, execute the command:
```
npm run test:dev
```

To run all tests faster and without UI which is the recommended way to run them all, use:
```
npm run test:all
```
